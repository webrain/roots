# [weroots Theme](https://github.com/webrain/weroots)

weroots is a Wordpress starter theme based on [Roots Theme](http://roots.io/).

The theme is based on SASS, so it requires the sass ruby gem, it uses [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage frontend dependencies and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to execute tasks.

## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/webrain/weroots.git` - and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website. [Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then install the dependencies for weroots contained in `package.json` by running the following from the theme directory:

```
npm install
```

Then [install Bower](http://bower.io) and install the frontend dependencies contained in `bower.json` by running the following from the root theme directory:

```
bower install
```

Then to finalize the setup just run the following command:

```
grunt weroots-setup
```

The ruby `sass` gem is required to compile the scss files. To install that just execute:

```
gem install sass
```

This will move assets files in meaningful directories, compiles and minify javascript and css for the first time.
Now you can enable the theme from the Wordpress appearance panel.

## Theme Development

After you've installed Grunt and ran `npm install` from the theme root, use `grunt watch` to watch for updates to your Sass and JS files and Grunt will automatically re-build as you write your code.
You can also use a [Livereload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) for your browser to get live page reloading.

## Configuration

Edit `lib/config.php` to enable or disable support for various theme functions and to define constants that are used throughout the theme.

Edit `lib/init.php` to setup custom navigation menus and post thumbnail sizes.

## Documentation

The theme documentation is a work in progress. You can refer to the [Roots theme documentation](http://roots.io/docs) for now, this theme shares a lot with Roots.
